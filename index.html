                    <h2>The Problem With Yelp Reviews</h2>
                    <p>Yelp reviews help us make important decisions about where we spend our time and money, and this information has transformed the way people think about businesses and, arguably, made us more savvy consumers.  But, they aren’t always as accurate as you might expect, if taken at face value and purely based on stars alone, because frequently the reviews people leave will contradict their rating, making it difficult to know how people feel actually feel about businesses.    </p>

                    <h2>Reasons Reviews Aren't Always Helpful</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes it’s that yelp users are angry when they write the review but when it comes time to give the restaurant a star rating they feel confined by the one to five system with no option to leave a half star, so they round up or down, severely impacting the restaurant’s overall review and skewing it one way or the other.  Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. It looks so good, I might as well not stop.</p>

                    <h2>How Reliable are Yelp Ratings?</h2>
                    <p>Yelp reviews are notoriously unreliable and if you ever look closely you’ll see major discrepancies with the star ratings. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. We'll put a happy little sky in here. Happy painting, God bless. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.

                    <p> Do an almighty painting with us. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. You can create anything that makes you happy. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen.

                        You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Just make a decision and let it go. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world.
